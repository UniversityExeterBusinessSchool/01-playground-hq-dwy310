# My Structure - Student 10

## What I See in My Data
2 levels, 6 Letter H's on top and 5 Letter V's on the bottom.
The V's is unevenly seperated by the 3rd H on the bottom; 3 V's on the left, 1.5 space, 3 V's on the right
Width 5, Type Arch and Color Yellow

## What I Think This Means
Build a arch with 2 levels with yellow blocks 5 square blocks width for the lower level

## What This Could Be
An arch?

## Questions I Have
1. What do the letters mean?
2. Is the uneven spacing on the right intentional?
3. Does the "type" actually mean the structure to build?
